# PHPUnitPatternsStan
This is an extension for PHPStan that adds some rules based on 
the smells in the XUnit Patterns book by Gerard Meszaros.


## Installation

To use this extension, require it in Composer:

```
composer require --dev xunitpatterns/xunitpatterns-stan
```

That is all you need to do if you have 
[phpstan/extension-installer](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer) 
then that's all you need to do.

Otherwise, you will need to include the rules manually in your phpstan.neon file.
